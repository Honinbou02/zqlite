  - [ ] Asset management with relationship mapping

- [ ] **GhostDock Registry Support** 
  - [ ] Blob metadata storage with deduplication tracking
  - [ ] User authentication and permissions
  - [ ] Image layer relationship storage

- [ ] **Zepplin Package Manager**
  - [ ] Package metadata with versioning
  - [ ] Dependency resolution storage
  - [ ] Download statistics tracking

- [ ] **GhostFlow AI Workflows**
  - [ ] Workflow state persistence
  - [ ] Event sourcing tables
  - [ ] Process orchestration metadata

- [ ] **GhostBay Object Storage**
  - [ ] S3-compatible metadata storage
  - [ ] Bucket and ACL management
  - [ ] Object versioning tracking

## üìä Month 1: Production Ready
- [ ] **Reliability**
  - [ ] WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) improvements
  - [ ] ACID transaction guarantees
  - [ ] Crash recovery testing
  - [ ] Memory leak fixes

- [ ] **Security Basics**
  - [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
  - [ ] Basic authentication (API keys)
  - [ ] Audit logging for critical operations

- [ ] **Developer Experience**
  - [ ] Better error messages with line numbers
  - [ ] CLI improvements (interactive shell)
  - [ ] Migration system for schema changes

## üöÄ Month 2-3: Advanced Features
- [ ] **HTTP API Server**
  - [ ] REST endpoints for all operations
  - [ ] JSON responses
  - [ ] Authentication middleware
  - [ ] Rate limiting basics

- [ ] **Specialized Modules**
  - [ ] Time-series data support (for metrics)
  - [ ] Full-text search (for documentation/tickets)
  - [ ] Geospatial support (for asset location)

- [ ] **Client Libraries**
  - [ ] Improved Zig native client
  - [ ] Basic Rust client for your Rust projects
  - [ ] Python client for scripting

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Priority

### Week 1 (Immediate)
```zig
// Add these features first
- JSON/JSONB data type
- Window functions
- Connection pooling
- Error handling improvements
```

### Week 2 (Core SQL)
```zig
// PostgreSQL compatibility essentials
- CTEs and recursive queries  
- Array operations
- UUID support
- Better date/time handling
```

### Week 3-4 (Your Apps)
```zig
// Direct support for your projects
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Blob storage metadata
- Package registry tables
- Authentication tables
```

## üéØ Success Metrics (Realistic)
- **Performance**: 10K QPS (not 100K, but solid)
- **Concurrency**: 100 connections (not 10K, but practical)  
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime (not 99.99%, but good)
- **Compatibility**: 80% PostgreSQL features (focused on what you need)

## üîß Quick Wins This Week
1. **Fix current test failures** - get to 100% pass rate
2. **Add JSON support** - modern apps need this
3. **Improve error messages** - save debugging time
4. **Basic connection pooling** - handle multiple clients
5. **PostgreSQL data types** - UUID, arrays, better dates
